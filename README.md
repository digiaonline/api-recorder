This recorder can record a data source periodically and then replay the 
recordings. It can be used for testing purposes when developing apps based on 
data feeds whose content change regularly, like news or sports apps. See the 
wiki page for instructions.

The typical usage is to:
- record a set of urls
- prepare a test version of the app, replacing the url of the server by the url of the player in the recorder
- use the player controls and see the result on the test app
